description: AST and tooling facts checked against Oxlint 1.87, ESLint 9.39, typescript-eslint 8.71
---

Checked empirically against Oxlint 1.87 (Vite+ 1.1.0), ESLint 9.39, and
`@typescript-eslint/parser` 8.71:

- Both hosts hand rules a TypeScript-ESTree tree. String literals are node type
  **`Literal`** with a `.value`.
- `TSESTree` node `type`s are a string enum, but comparing one to a string
  literal (`node.type === "Literal"`) type-checks.
- Abstract members are **`TSAbstractMethodDefinition`** and
  **`TSAbstractPropertyDefinition`**, not `MethodDefinition` and
  `PropertyDefinition`. A rule matching one must match both.
- An overload signature or abstract method is a `TSEmptyBodyFunctionExpression`
  under its method node, and interface methods are `TSMethodSignature`. A rule
  walking functions must include both or they slip through.
- `MethodDefinition` needs no visitor of its own: its `value` is visited in its
  own right, so adding one double reports.
- `Property` covers destructuring as well as object literals. Check
  `node.parent.type === "ObjectExpression"` to tell a declared key from a bound
  name.
- `TSParameterProperty` wraps the parameter; the type annotation's parent is
  still the inner `Identifier`, with `optional` populated.
- **`AccessorProperty` type annotations are walked** by both hosts, unlike Deno.
  `accessor a?: T` does not parse under Oxlint.
- Oxlint's parser rejects a required parameter after an optional one, so test
  snippets must be valid TypeScript, not just valid syntax.
- Oxlint's `RuleTester` counts **columns from 0**, ESLint's from 1.
- ESLint's `RuleTester` parses as TypeScript only when given a `.ts` filename
  with `@typescript-eslint/parser`; the harness sets both.
- The type systems do not meet: Oxlint runs ESLint rules unchanged at
  runtime, but the types don't line up. See [[rule-typing-explicitrule]] and
  [[plugin-dual-ruletester]].
- Oxlint loads a `.ts` plugin from a relative path directly on Node 24, `#`
  imports included. It could also load a JSON import of `package.json`, but
  this repo bans that import ([[ts-only-files-and-imports]]).
- Oxlint and Oxfmt respect `.gitignore`; that is the only reason `dist/` and
  `node_modules/` are not linted.
